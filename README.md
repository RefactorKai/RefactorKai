# Hi, I'm RefactorKai (Nguyen Vinh) 👋

I'm a **First-year Computer Science student** at **Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT)**. 
Currently learning how to turn caffeine into C++ code without the compiler yelling at me.

### 🛠️ What I'm learning right now:
* **C++ Fundamentals**: Exploring memory, pointers, and why segmentation faults happen to good people.
* **Algorithms**: Figuring out Bitmasking and Dynamic Programming for class assignments.
* **Testing**: Writing basic test scripts to make sure my logic actually works before I submit it.

### 🎮 Interests:
* Low-level programming and game logic.
* Trying to write "clean" code (and then refactoring it five minutes later).
* Solving puzzles that I created myself by making typos.

### 📫 You can give me some advices at:
* **Location**: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
* **Email**: vinhuni2k7@gmail.com
